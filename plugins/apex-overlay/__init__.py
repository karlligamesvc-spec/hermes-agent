"""apex-overlay plugin — boot hook that applies ApexNodes seams onto upstream.

This bundled plugin is the *load-time entry point* for the ``apex_overlay``
package. Its only job is to call each overlay seam's ``apply()`` during plugin
discovery, which the CLI runs early in startup (``cli.py`` deferred-startup,
before the ``/model`` picker cache prewarm) and the gateway runs at boot
(``gateway/run.py``). That ordering is what lets the hc-392 provider denylist
take effect *before* the picker's background prewarm would otherwise fetch a
disabled provider's catalog.

Why a plugin (and not an in-place import in model_switch.py)?
------------------------------------------------------------
The whole point of ``apex_overlay/`` is to keep our behavioral debt OUT of hot
upstream files so they merge cleanly on the next bump. A bundled plugin +
``apply()`` keeps the upstream files byte-for-byte upstream; the only non-code
touch is one line in ``cli-config.yaml.example`` adding ``apex-overlay`` to
``plugins.enabled`` — the cleanest seam tier (config > plugin > in-place).

See ``apex_overlay/README.md`` for the full pattern.

    take down plugin discovery or the host.
