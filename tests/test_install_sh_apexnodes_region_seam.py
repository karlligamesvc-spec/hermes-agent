"""Seam-test for the ApexNodes region-detect / China-mirror overlay.

The region self-detection + domestic mirror / COS source downgrade was extracted
out of the hot install.sh / install.ps1 files into our own namespace under
scripts/lib/apexnodes-region-detect.{sh,ps1} (see apex_overlay/README.md and
docs/OVERLAY-SEAM-AUDIT.md). The installer keeps only a self-locating `source`
hook plus a few one-line call sites.

A `source`-based seam is only safe while three invariants hold, and an upstream
bump (or a careless edit) could silently break any of them — turning the China
install path into a quiet fall-through to blocked github.com / pypi.org. This
test makes each invariant a LOUD failure instead:

  1. The installer still sources the lib (the seam is wired, not disarmed).
  2. The lib still defines the public functions the installer calls.
  3. The lib still ships as a sibling of the installer in EVERY materialized
     copy that carries our CN logic (desktop bundle + PyPI wheel), since the
     installer sources it from a path relative to its own on-disk location.

It deliberately does NOT re-test the detection heuristic itself (that lives in
the lib and is covered by its own behavioral smoke); it pins the SEAM.
