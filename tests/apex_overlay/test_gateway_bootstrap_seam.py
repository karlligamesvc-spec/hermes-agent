"""Seam-test + behavior test for the apex_overlay hc-384/385 gateway bootstrap.

This pins the upstream symbols that ``apex_overlay.gateway_bootstrap``
monkey-patches/depends on, so an upstream rename/move turns a *silently
reverted-to-blocking* gateway startup into a *loud CI failure* — the
prerequisite for trusting the monkey-patch (see ``apex_overlay/README.md``).

What the seam guards
====================
``gateway/run.py`` keeps the per-platform connect loop as one extracted method,
``GatewayRunner._connect_configured_platforms`` (in-tree body = upstream's
original sequential, *blocking* loop). ``gateway_bootstrap.apply()`` replaces
that method with the background-connect version (Feishu attaches off the
critical path so the API conversation surface is ready first — hc-384/385) and
binds eight helper methods. If upstream removes the extraction point or renames
any helper dependency, the patch can't bind and we'd silently fall back to the
blocking loop — these tests fail loudly instead.

This file ALSO proves the behavior the original +276 in-place lines provided:
a ``CONNECT_IN_BACKGROUND`` adapter (Feishu) is scheduled in the background and
does NOT block the loop returning, while an ordinary adapter connects inline.

Run via ``scripts/run_tests_parallel.py`` (per-file fresh interpreter), not a
single in-process pytest — a process-wide monkey-patch behaves differently
under single-process isolation.
